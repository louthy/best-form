# best form

_The best form of documentation is the code itself_

This is a C# doc-gen tool

* Parses C# source code to extract the XML documentation as well as a fully tokenised structure of the code itself
  * Uses [the LanguageExt.Parsec library](https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Parsec/LanguageExt.Parsec/index.htm) to parse the XML documents

See the [language-ext API reference for a demo of this tool](https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Core/)
